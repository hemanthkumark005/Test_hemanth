As part of this POC, we will deliver a working GenAI-assisted review capability that can evaluate selected compliance assessment checklists against regulatory and policy references. This includes setting up a secure document retrieval approach so that all AI outputs remain fully grounded in approved content, building the compliance evaluation logic with audit-specific checks, and automating the generation of a Reviewer Pack that summarizes findings in a clear, audit-friendly format. We will also provide SME feedback integration, traceability documentation, and a final performance report to help Audit teams assess whether this approach should be expanded further.
