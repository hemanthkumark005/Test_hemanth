As part of this POC, we will deliver a working GenAI-assisted review capability that can evaluate selected compliance assessment checklists against regulatory and policy references. This includes setting up a secure document retrieval approach so that all AI outputs remain fully grounded in approved content, building the compliance evaluation logic with audit-specific checks, and automating the generation of a Reviewer Pack that summarizes findings in a clear, audit-friendly format. We will also provide SME feedback integration, traceability documentation, and a final performance report to help Audit teams assess whether this approach should be expanded further.


Working with Lavkush has been a great experience. Although our Mule audit work is still in progress, I have already seen the clarity and ownership he brings to problem-solving. His contributions during our PDF translation code reviews were very helpful — he provides structured feedback and ensures we think through edge cases thoroughly.
In addition to project collaboration, he was my onboarding buddy and played a key role in helping me settle in. From gaining access to tools to understanding team processes, he was always approachable and patient. His support made my initial days much smoother.
Overall, I truly appreciate his collaborative nature, technical involvement, and willingness to help. Looking forward to delivering strong outcomes together on the ongoing audit initiative.

I would like to acknowledge Shubham’s proactive contribution in conducting a VS Code setup and onboarding session for the team, which significantly improved our development efficiency. Additionally, his work on Project Phoenix demonstrated strong code quality, structure, and maintainability. Excellent initiative and delivery.
