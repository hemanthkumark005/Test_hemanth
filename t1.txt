Over the past three months, I have contributed to GIA’s strategy by delivering high-quality analytics work on time, improving audit coverage through automation, and strengthening team capability through mentoring and knowledge sharing. I actively partnered with audit teams and stakeholders, exercised professional scepticism to enhance the effectiveness of analytics, and ensured ethical and compliant delivery throughout.
🔹 Key Contributions & Impact (Aligned to Evaluation Criteria)
Timely and high-quality audit delivery
