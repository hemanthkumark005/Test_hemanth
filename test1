Problem Statement

Retail accounts used by scammers often show sudden inflows from victims followed by rapid outward transfers, frequently to known mule accounts. Detecting such short-lived but high-velocity patterns early is difficult through traditional rule-based monitoring.

Objectives

Identify scammer-like retail accounts by analyzing behavioral anomalies such as abrupt inflow spikes, high fund dispersion, and short balance retention.

Prioritize and escalate accounts that have direct or indirect transactional linkages with known mule accounts, signalling coordinated fraud networks.

Deliver explainable, data-driven risk insights that enable timely blocking, enhanced monitoring, and support for audit and fraud-control actions.

Proposal

Apply data-science-based behavioral and graph analytics to detect scammer accounts by combining anomaly scores from transaction patterns with proximity to confirmed mule accounts, generating a ranked list for proactive investigation.
