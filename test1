Fuzzy Address Matching & Link Analysis:
Use fuzzy logic and link analysis to detect individuals or groups reusing or slightly modifying the same address.
This uncovers hidden networks tied to past fraud, rejected, or charged-off clients that bypass onboarding checks.

Cross-Product & Temporal Clustering:
Cluster linked applications across products and time to reveal recurring address patterns â€” short bursts, seasonal re-entries, or delayed reapplications.
These temporal insights expose systematic control gaps or collusive behavior across entities.
