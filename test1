1. Human Review Still Required

LLM only highlights gaps; it cannot make compliance judgements or certify correctness.

2. No Rewriting of Content

The system does not generate or rewrite assessment text — it only recommends when a rewrite is needed, with reasons and citations.

3. Dependent on Document Quality

OCR noise, inconsistent formatting, or missing supporting documents can reduce evaluation accuracy.

4. Retrieval Limitations

RAG retrieves the closest matching text but may miss broader context if regulatory clauses span multiple sections.

5. Context Length Constraints

Long multi-page rows may exceed LLM context limits, requiring chunking and multiple passes, which can affect accuracy and runtime.
