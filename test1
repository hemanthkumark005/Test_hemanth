Fuzzy Address Matching & Link Analysis:
Apply fuzzy logic and link analysis to detect individuals or related groups reusing or slightly modifying common addresses.
This helps surface hidden linkages with prior fraud, charged-off, or rejected clients that evade traditional onboarding checks.

Cross-Product & Temporal Clustering:
Cluster linked applications across products and time periods to identify recurring address patterns â€” such as seasonal re-entries or coordinated bursts.
These temporal patterns highlight systematic control weaknesses and potential collusive behavior across entities.
